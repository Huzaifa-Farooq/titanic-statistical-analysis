## Regression Analysis

<div>

For the purpose of our analysis, we will focus on Fare and Age, as these are the only continuous variables available in the dataset, while the rest are categorical. Initially, we will visualize the relationship between these two variables and perform a detailed analysis. Subsequently, we will expand our approach by incorporating multiple variables into the model, aiming to achieve higher ùëÖ\^2 value.

## Fare & Age

</div>

```{r}
# here we will apply fare limit of (0, 20] to reduce outliers
df_mod_no_outliers =  df_mod[df_mod$Fare > 0 & df_mod$Fare <= 20, ]
# 1. Visualize the relationship between Age and Fare in the dataset without outliers
plot(df_mod_no_outliers$Age, df_mod_no_outliers$Fare, 
     main = "Scatter plot of Age vs Fare (No Outliers)", 
     xlab = "Age", 
     ylab = "Fare", 
     pch = 19, 
     col = "blue")

# Fit a linear regression model
linear_model_no_outliers <- lm(Fare ~ Age, data = df_mod_no_outliers)

# Add regression line to the plot
abline(linear_model_no_outliers, col = "red")

# 2. Display the summary of the linear regression model

# 3. Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤)

cat("R¬≤: ", r_squared_no_outliers, "\n")

```

### Interpretation

`lm()`by default uses Least Squared Method to fit the linear regression model as this method minimizes the error to find the best-fitting line.

-   **Intercept (Estimate: 10.94)**:

    -   When `Age` is 0, the expected value of `Fare` is approximately 10.94. Although, this may not be practically meaningful since `Age` cannot be zero in this dataset.

-   **Age Coefficient (Estimate: -0.02541)**:

    -   For each one-unit increase in `Age`, the `Fare` is expected to decrease by approximately 0.025 units. This indicates a negative relationship between `Age` and `Fare`.

-   **R-squared (0.009)**:

    -   The R-squared value of 0.009 means that only about **0.9%** of the variation in `Fare` is explained by `Age`. This is very low, suggesting that `Age` alone is not a strong predictor of `Fare`.

-   **Residuals**:

    -   The residuals represent the difference between the observed values and the predicted values of `Fare`. The distribution of residuals shows:

        -   **Minimum residual**: -6.415

        -   **1st Quartile (25%)**: -2.480

        -   **Median (50%)**: -1.589

        -   **3rd Quartile (75%)**: 2.712

        -   **Maximum residual**: 9.606

    This range indicates that the model‚Äôs predictions are off by up to 9.606 units in either direction.

-   **S.D. of Random Errors (Residual Standard Error)**:

    -   The **residual standard error** (S.E.) is 3.263. This is the standard deviation of the residuals, and it represents the typical size of the error in predicting `Fare` based on `Age`. A lower value indicates a better fit, but here we see that there is room for improvement.

-   **Degrees of Freedom**:

    -   In a simple linear regression model, the **degrees of freedom** (df) for the residuals is the total number of observations minus 2 (one for the intercept and one for the slope). Here, we have 382 degrees of freedom, which means that there are 382 data points used to estimate the model's parameters.

-   **Hypothesis Testing Result:**

    -   The key output here is the t-statistic and the p-value for the `Age` variable.

        -   **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: Œ≤Age=0 (Age has no effect on Fare)

        -   **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Œ≤Age‚â†0 (Age affects Fare)

        <!-- -->

        -   **p-value for Age (0.0626)**: Since the p-value is greater than the typical significance level of **0.05**, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. This means there is not enough evidence to conclude that `Age` significantly affects `Fare` at the 5% significance level. However, the result is still marginally significant at the 10% significance level.

        -   **Conclusion**: Based on this hypothesis test, we conclude that there is insufficient statistical evidence to suggest that `Age` is a significant predictor of `Fare`.

## Multiple variables Regression Analysis

```{r}
linear_model <- lm(Fare ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Embarked, data = df_mod)

# Display the summary of the new linear regression model
summary(linear_model)

# Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤)
r_squared <- summary(linear_model)$r.squared
print(paste("R¬≤ after removing outliers: ", r_squared))
```

-   Since R\^2 has a lower value we check for existance of outliers that may be effecting the calculation.

```{r}
# Visualize Fare distribution using a boxplot
boxplot(df_mod$Fare, main = "Boxplot of Fare", ylab = "Fare")
```

<div>

Since we have outliers we will drop them and refit the model.

</div>

```{r}

# Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
Q1 <- quantile(df_mod$Fare, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(df_mod$Fare, 0.75)

IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1

lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value

# Remove rows with Fare outside the bounds (outliers)
df_mod_no_outliers <- df_mod[df_mod$Fare >= lower_bound & df_mod$Fare <= upper_bound, ]

print(paste("Rows before removing outliers: ", nrow(df_mod)))
print(paste("Rows after removing outliers: ", nrow(df_mod_no_outliers)))

# Fit the linear regression model again after removing outliers
linear_model_no_outliers <- lm(Fare ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Embarked, data = df_mod_no_outliers)

# Display the summary of the new linear regression model
summary(linear_model_no_outliers)

# Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤)
r_squared_no_outliers <- summary(linear_model_no_outliers)$r.squared
print(paste("R¬≤ after removing outliers: ", r_squared_no_outliers))
```

#### **Before Outlier Removal**:

-   **Model Fit**: The R\^2 value was 0.39, indicating that the model explained only 39% of the variance in the Fare variable.

-   **Residuals**: Residual standard error was 41.5, suggesting large variations between observed and predicted values, likely due to the influence of outliers.

#### **After Outlier Removal**:

-   **Improved Model Fit**: The R\^2 value increased to 0.637, meaning the model now explains approximately 63.7% of the variance in Fare, a significant improvement.

-   **Reduced Residuals**: The residual standard error dropped to 8.333, reflecting better predictive performance with smaller errors.

### Interpretation

-   The removal of outliers significantly improved the model's performance, as evidenced by the increase in R\^2 and decrease in residual error.

-   The final model explains **63.7% of the variation in Fare**, with the remaining **36.3%** attributable to factors not included in the model or random error.

-   The strongest predictor of Fare is Pclass, with a negative coefficient indicating that higher-class passengers pay significantly more.

-   SibSp and Parch positively influence Fare, showing that families or groups tend to pay higher overall fares.

-   Embarked had a modest negative impact, potentially reflecting differences in fare structures across embarkation points.

#### Hypothesis Testing

-   **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: Œ≤i=0 (The predictor does not have an effect on the outcome)

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Œ≤i‚â†0 (The predictor has an effect on the outcome)

-   **Pclass:**

    -   **Coefficient**: ‚àí12.24817

    -   **t-value**: ‚àí24.237

    -   **p-value**: \<2e‚àí16

    **Interpretation**: The p-value is extremely small, which means that `Pclass` is highly statistically significant in predicting `Fare`. We reject the null hypothesis, meaning `Pclass` has a significant effect on `Fare`.

    #### c) **Sex:**

    -   **Coefficient**: 0.34218

    -   **t-value**: 0.450

    -   **p-value**: 0.65284

    **Interpretation**: The p-value for `Sex` is 0.65284, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis, meaning `Sex` does not have a statistically significant effect on `Fare` in this model.

    #### d) **Age:**

    -   **Coefficient**: 0.02832

    -   **t-value**: 1.033

    -   **p-value**: 0.3018

    **Interpretation**: The p-value for `Age` is 0.3018, which is greater than 0.05. This means we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis for `Age`, suggesting that `Age` does not have a statistically significant effect on `Fare` in this model.

    #### e) **SibSp:**

    -   **Coefficient**: 5.26747

    -   **t-value**: 12.994

    -   **p-value**: \<2e‚àí16

    **Interpretation**: The p-value for `SibSp` is extremely small, indicating that `SibSp` is highly statistically significant. We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that `SibSp` has a significant effect on `Fare`.

    #### f) **Parch:**

    -   **Coefficient**: 4.55016

    -   **t-value**: 10.062

    -   **p-value**: \<2e‚àí16

    **Interpretation**: The p-value for `Parch` is extremely small, which suggests that `Parch` is statistically significant in predicting `Fare`. We reject the null hypothesis for `Parch`, meaning `Parch` has a significant effect on `Fare`.

    #### g) **Embarked:**

    -   **Coefficient**: ‚àí1.56087

    -   **t-value**: ‚àí3.208

    -   **p-value**: 0.00141

    -   **Interpretation**: The p-value for `Embarked` is 0.00141, which is less than 0.05. This suggests that `Embarked` is statistically significant in predicting `Fare`. We reject the null hypothesis for `Embarked`, meaning `Embarked` has a significant effect on `Fare`.

# Randomly sample 100 observations from Age
sample_age <- sample(df$Age, size = 100, replace = FALSE)

# Estimate the population standard deviation using the entire dataset
population_sd <- sd(df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate the sample mean

print(paste("90% Confidence Interval: (", round(lower_bound, 2), ",", round(upper_bound, 2), ")"))

```

### Interpretation

-   **Point Estimate = 29.99** is the **sample mean** age of the passengers. This is the best estimate of the **true average age** of the entire population based on the sample with margin of error of **2.85 years** means that true population mean could differ from the sample mean by up to **2.85 years** due to sampling variability.

-   The **90% confidence interval** of **(27.6, 32.38)** means that, based on sample, we are **90% confident** that the true average age of all passengers in the population falls between **27.6 years** and **32.38 years**.

## Fare

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

sample_fare <- sample(df$Fare, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
population_sd <- sd(df$Fare, na.rm = TRUE) 

sample_mean_fare <- mean(sample_fare, na.rm = TRUE)
n <- length(sample_fare) # Sample size

margin_of_error = 1.96 * (population_sd / sqrt(n))
print(paste("Estimated Population Standard Deviation (œÉ):", round(population_sd, 2)))
print(paste("Point Estimate (Mean):", round(sample_mean_fare, 2)))
print(paste("Margin of Error:", round(margin_of_error, 2)))

# Calculate the Z-value for a 96% confidence level
alpha <- 1 - 0.98
z_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)

# Calculate the margin of error for CI
margin_of_error_ci <- z_value * (population_sd / sqrt(n))

# Calculate the confidence interval
lower_bound <- sample_mean_fare - margin_of_error_ci
upper_bound <- sample_mean_fare + margin_of_error_ci

print(paste("98% Confidence Interval: (", round(lower_bound, 2), ",", round(upper_bound, 2), ")"))

```

### Interpretation

-   **Point Estimate = 28.8** is the **sample mean** fare that passengers paid. This is the best estimate of the **true average fare** of the entire population based on the sample with margin of error of **\$9.74** means that true population mean could differ from the sample mean by up to **9.74** due to sampling variability.

-   The **98% confidence interval** of **(17.24, 40.36)** means that, based on sample, we are **98% confident** that the true average fare of all passengers in the population falls between \$17.24 - **\$40.36**.
